# Physics 4A
This course is the first physics course at Saddleback College focusing 
on mechanics. These projects are published in GitHub because I was 
required to create 2 formal lab write-up. Because I heard by Computer Science
professor Begalli uses the programming language LaTeX, I decided to give it a
shot and use LaTeX to create my formal lab write-ups. 

- *Formal 1: Lab about Measuring g
- *Formal 2: Hooke's Law lab

Other labs I did but did not need a formal on:
- Measuring g*
- Range of a Projectile
- Newton's 2nd Law of Motion
- Conservation of Energy and Momentum
- Moment of Inertia
- Hooke's Law*
- Archimede's Principle & Simple Pendulum

Topics learned in class:
- Vectors
- 1-D Kinematics
- 2-D Kinematics
- Newton's Laws
- Work & Kinetic Energy
- Conservation of Energy
- Linear Momentum
- Rotational Kinematics & Dynamics
- Angular Momentum & Torque
- Equilibrium & Elasticity
- Gravitation
- Fluids
- Oscillations
