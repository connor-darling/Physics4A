\section{What is the purpose of this lab?}
The purpose of this lab is to measure gavitational acceleration and compare it to the theoretical value
of the gravitational value of Earth $g$ found to be about $9.80\frac{m}{s^2}$
\section{What are you trying to measure}
In the lab the goal is to attempt to measure the value $g$
