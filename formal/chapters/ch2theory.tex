\chapter{Theory}
Objects that fall freely near Earth will accelerate at approximately $9.80\frac{m}{s^2}$
if they:
\begin{itemize}
  \item are near the surface of the Earth
  \item are at a geographic location where the Earth's radius is approximately its average value
\end{itemize}

  When air friction is ignored, the acceleration of an object falling is 
independent of the mass, volume, and shape. For short distances and small 
objects it is not unreasonable to neglect air resistance, but for long 
distances and large objects, air resistance is significant.
Acceleration of gravity $g$ can be calculated using kinematics

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Delta y$ is the displacement
  \item $t$ is the time
  \item $v_0$ is the initial velocity
  \item $v_f$ is the final veolcity
  \item $a = g_{exp}$ $a$ is the experimental acceleration due to gravity
\end{itemize}
