\section{Include Values}
calculated fron data, graphs, answers to Qs

\section{Average Time Calculated}
In the following data tables, the average time of the fall for each ball at 
each height is calculated

\section{Graphed Data}
The following graphs for the small and large ball and their avaerge fall times
at each height squared then divided by 2, are plotted on a scatter plot and 
given a linear line with a calculated slope.
