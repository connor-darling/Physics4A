\chapter{Suggestions for Improvement}

Due to the age of this lab, over the years the professors of the Saddleback College
Physics faculty have implemented almost all of the improvements that can be used for the lab.\\\\
Despite this, if I were to improve the lab experiment in any way, it would be to 
make sure the student is setting up their equiqment on a level surface.\\\\
During my lab I know that I found it difficult to gage whether or not my experiment was
setup in the most accurate way. I also did not take into account the height of the 
sensor the ball was being dropped onto so I wasted precious time re-doing drops to get an
accurate measure. Therefore, I think that the procedure section should add a note to consider this.
