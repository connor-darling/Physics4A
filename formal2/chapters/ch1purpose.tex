\chapter{Purpose}

To verify Hookeâ€™s law and calculate the spring constant.

\chapter{Theory}

The force due to a spring stretched (or compressed) a distance $\Delta x$ from the 
equilibrium position is given by the following expression:\\\\
\centerline $\vec{F_s} = -k\Delta \vec{x}$

\\where $s$ = (force exerted by) spring\\
\setlength\parindent{24pt} $k$ = the spring constant (in N/m)
