\section{Procedure Equipment}

The necessary equipment for this lab is as follow: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Meter Stick
  \item Spring
  \item Weights 
  \item Clamp
  \item Rods
  \item Suspension Clamp
\end{itemize}

\section{Position Measurements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The equipment is to be set up as shown below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hang a weight from the end of the spring. For the long spring use weights ranging
        from 0.5 kg to 2 kg and for the short spring use weights ranging from 2 kg to 4 
        kg. Make sure you do not select too heavy of a weight or the spring will 
        permanently stretch.
  \item Measure the distance $(\Delta x)$ the spring is stretched from its equilibrium
        position $(x = 0)$.
  \item Repeat the above measurement for at least 7 more weights.
\end{itemize}
