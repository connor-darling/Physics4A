\chapter{Analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For each weight, calculate the force $(F = mg, g = 9.8\frac{m}{s^2})$ exerted on
        the spring by the Earth's gravitational force.

  \item Plot the force $F$ versus the distance the spring is stretched $(\Delta x)$.
        Based on Hooke's law your graph should follow a straight line.

  \item Draw a best-fit line between the points and calculate the slope of the line.
        The slope of the line will correspond to the spring constant $k$.

  \item Compare your experimental value(s) of $k$ with the actual value(s) of $k$ for 
        your spring. (Long Spring k = 23 N/m \& Short Spring k = 98 N/m)

  \item Do your results agree with Hooke's law (i.e. is $F$ directly proportional to 
        $x$)?
\end{enumerate}
