\chapter{Analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For each weight, calculate the force $(F = mg, g = 9.8\frac{m}{s^2})$ exerted on
        the spring by the Earth's gravitational force.

  	\begin{tabular} { |p{2cm}|p{2cm}| }
			\hline
  		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Force Calculated for each Configuration of Mass} \\
			\hline 
			\centering Configuration of Mass & Experimental $F$ in Nm\\ 
			\hline
			#1 & 10.153\\
			\hline
			#2 & 19.923\\
			\hline
			#3 & 39.523\\
			\hline
			#4 & 59.114\\
			\hline
			#5 & 14.974\\
			\hline
			#6 & 34.565\\
			\hline
			#7 & 54.155\\
			\hline
			#8 & 24.794\\
			\hline
    \end{tabular}

  \item Plot the force $F$ versus the distance the spring is stretched $(\Delta x)$.
        Based on Hooke's law your graph should follow a straight line.

  \item Draw a best-fit line between the points and calculate the slope of the line.
        The slope of the line will correspond to the spring constant $k$.

  \item Compare your experimental value(s) of $k$ with the actual value(s) of $k$ for 
        your spring. (Long Spring k = 23 N/m \& Short Spring k = 98 N/m)

  \item Do your results agree with Hooke's law (i.e. is $F$ directly proportional to 
        $x$)?
\end{enumerate}
