\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the purpose of this lab was to measure an experimental spring 
constant $k_{exp}$ and compare it with the actual value of $278 \frac{N}{m}$. This was to be done 
by attaching a hanging spring and measuing the $x_i$ value of it. Then attaching
8 different configurations of that weight to the spring and measure the $x_f$
value. After finding the $\Delta x$, the force $F$ in Nm could be found.
Once plotting each force calculated versus $\Delta x$, a best fit slope was 
used to find the experimental $k_{exp}$.\\

\noindent Following this process, the $k_{exp}$ ended up being $276.52 \frac{N}{m}$. Though this is not
eaxctly $278 \frac {N}{m}$, the error allowed could account for this deviation from the actual
value. With the RSS error using greastest contributors ending up as $0.08\%$.\\

\noindent Furthermore, the backend error implementing \%difference was $0.53\%$.\\

\noindent Considering the purpose of the lab, the result, and factors of possible error,
the goal of this lab was accomplished.
