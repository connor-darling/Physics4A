\noindent Due to the age and simplicity of this lab, over the years the professors
of the Saddleback College Physics department have implemented almost all of the
improvements that can be made to this lab.\\

\noindent Despite this, if I were to improve the lab in any way, it would be to 
provide a much more indepth procedure section with an elaborate section on 
apparatus set up. With that, clear instructions of where and how to measure
should be made. If I did not have access to an example of my professors 
set up, I do not think my error would be as minimal as it was. Furthermore,
without the guidence of my professor, I would have taken incorrect measurements.\\
